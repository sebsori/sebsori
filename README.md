# Hey! 👋 I'm Sebastian

**Mapping the world, one commit at a time** 🗺️

I'm a geospatial sciences student based in Vienna who loves turning messy spatial data into something useful and beautiful. When I'm not wrangling coordinates, you'll find me contributing to OpenStreetMap or exploring new ways to visualize geographic information.

## 🚀 What I Do

**By day:** Study geospatial sciences and work with spatial data  
**By night:** Contribute to open mapping projects and build geo-tools

I believe the best maps are the ones that help people understand their world better—whether that's finding the nearest composting toilet in Vienna or analyzing urban development patterns.

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

**Core Stack:**
- 🐍 **Python** - GeoPandas, Shapely, Matplotlib
- 🌐 **JavaScript** - Leaflet, web mapping
- 🗄️ **SQL/PostGIS** - Spatial databases
- 🗺️ **QGIS** - Desktop GIS

**Currently exploring:**
- Modern web mapping frameworks
- Cloud-based geospatial workflows
- OSM ecosystem tools (iD, JOSM, NSI)

## 🌍 Open Source Contributions

Active contributor to the **OpenStreetMap** community:
- 📝 Name Suggestion Index (brand presets)
- 🗺️ Mapping Austria & improving data quality
- 🤝 Supporting local OSM initiatives

## 🌱 Always Learning

Right now I'm diving deeper into:
- Advanced spatial analysis with Python
- Automated map generation
- Contributing to larger open source GIS projects
- Building responsive geospatial web applications

## 💡 Fun Facts

- 🇦🇹 Based in Vienna, where I probably know where the best öklo toilets are
- 🗺️ Passionate about making spatial data accessible to everyone
- 📊 Love finding patterns in geographic data
- 🌐 Believe open data makes the world better

## 📬 Let's Connect!

Always happy to chat about:
- Geospatial projects
- OpenStreetMap contributions
